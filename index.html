							<h2>Who I am</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hi, my name is John Smith and thank you for your time and interest. 
							I am software developer with an A.A.S. in Programming from Pelissippi State. 
							I have spent most of my career in sales but decided to go back to school
							to pursue a career in my passion for all things technology. I was raised to be honest and
							extremely hard-working and I strive for that to show in my work. I love to learn new things
							and am always looking for ways to expand my skills. In my senior year of my program
							I took the lead on my groups Capstone (final) project and maintained direct contact with 
							the product owners on a real world developement project and am currently a Quality Assurance Analyst 1 with Clayton
							Homes' technology department, working on test automation, as well as load and performance testing. I feel that over the course of 
							my degree, my program did a great job of making us well rounded developers and gave me a great foundation towards 
							becoming a full stack software engineer. I have 2+ years of experience working with both Java and C#/.NET, 3+ years working in 
							web developement languages and frameworks such as Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and PHP. I am also familiar with the SDLC as a whole, as well as Agile methodologies
							and working on a SCRUM team. Unfortuantely, due to NDA's, I can not showcase my professional project experience so I will only be making projects I 
							worked on during the course of my degree and in my free time available here.
